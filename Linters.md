The Python compiler checks program syntax sufficiently to be able to run the program, or to report a syntax error. If you want more thorough checks of your Python code, you can download and install one or more third-party tools for the purpose. [pyflakes](https://oreil.ly/RPeeJ) is a very quick, lightweight checker: it’s not thorough, but it doesn’t import the modules it’s checking, which makes using it fast and safe. At the other end of the spectrum, [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) is very powerful and highly configurable; it’s not lightweight, but repays that by being able to check many style details in highly customizable ways based on editable configuration files.[5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-in-a/9781098113544/ch02.html#ch01fn17) [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8) bundlespyflakes with other formatters and custom plug-ins, and can handle large codebases by spreading work across multiple processes. [black](https://pypi.org/project/black) and its variant [blue](https://pypi.org/project/blue)are intentionally less configurable; this makes them popular with widely dispersed project teams and open source projects in order to enforce a common Python style. To make sure you don’t forget to run them, you can incorporate one or more of these checkers/formatters into your workflow using the [pre-commitpackage](https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit).
